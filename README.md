# Dijkstras Algorithm CPP
 MATH209 Discrete Mathematics 2 final project. My implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Description
 This was the final project form MATH209. There are two excel files that represent the dataset that was used to create the software, any .csv file that follows that format will work within the project. Includes functions that transcribe the .csv into appropriate data types. 
 Follows simple input-output system. After the program loads your .csv file, just input the cities you wish to connect, one after another. Loops until the user exits the program.
 
## How to Use
 Just clone the repository to your local machine, and open the .cpb file. After that you can run the program.
 
 ## Licence 
  Feel free to use for whatever you wish. Give credit where credit is due, as I spent a long time creating this.
